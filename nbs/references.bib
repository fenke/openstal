    abstract  = {Some confusion was observed during the 7th International Workshop on Sap
        Flow (Seville, Spain, 21-24 October 2008) with respect to the use of symbols, units
        and physical quantities in presentations and during discussions. It was therefore
        decided at the end of the workshop that a technical note would be very useful with
        the aim to summarize the basics of the “Système International des Unités (SI)” and
        to focus on particular aspects that are relevant for sap flow studies. Starting from a
        number of standard papers that have been published in the past, an extra effort was
        made to put sap flow nomenclature against the physical background of plant-water
        relationships, of water flow in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and of transport
        equations for mass, heat and hydraulic flow. Information is given on the application
        of SI units and the main SI conventions. Tables are included for practical use of
        basic and derived SI units and for common abbreviations encountered in sap flow
        studies. An overview of a coherent nomenclature for sap flow studies, together with
        definitions of sap flow quantities, symbols and units is given as well.}

  abstract = {The electrical permittivity and conductivity of the bulk soil are a function of the permittivity and conductivity of the pore water. For soil water contents higher than 0.10 both functions are equal, facilitating in situ conductivity measurements of the pore water. A novel method is described, based on simultaneous measurements of permittivity and conductivity of the bulk soil from which the conductivity of the pore water can be calculated. A prototype of a pore water conductivity sensor based on this method is presented. Validation results show that the method can be used for a broad range of soils and is valid for water contents between 0.10 and saturation and for the conductivity of the pore water up to 0.3 S m−1},

    abstract = {Direct evidence for the link between stem diameter variations (SDV) and the daily canopy water status, i.e., daily water potentials (Ψ), is rare, particularly for tall trees. It thus remains unclear up to what degree SDV readings are useful to estimate daily canopy Ψ. We measured SDV with point dendrometers at the stem base of tall, mature individuals of six European forest tree species in a near-natural temperate forest and compared them with daily canopy Ψ during the growing seasons of 2014 (wet) and 2015 (dry). Stem diameter variations were de-trended for growth with two different approaches leading to the so-called tree water deficit (TWD). We found that midday Ψ can be predicted from TWD, independent of the growth-de-trending procedure to obtain TWD from SDV. Further, daily TWD was a better indicator for daily midday Ψ, particularly under dry conditions, than maximum daily shrinkage, another common quantity derived from SDV. Based on data from six temperate tree species, we conclude that TWD measured at the stem base is a consistent proxy for daily canopy midday Ψ of tall trees over the entire range of measured conditions.},
